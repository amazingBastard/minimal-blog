          About
        </h1>
				<p>My passion for computers started at an early age. I was young and impressionable, growing up in the city of Rovno, Ukraine. My family wasn't well off but we got by. We didn't have much access to technology then but some of it managed to slip past the border. In the early 90s was the first time I laid eyes on a computer. It was a friend's birthday and a couple of friends and I were invited over. We spent most of our times playing games on his computer. Who knew then that this machine will play an important role in my life.</p>

				<p>When I was about nine years old, my family moved to the United States. I was living in Ellensburg, Washington at the time with my mom, when a friend of her's gifted me an old computer. I was thrilled, this was my first personal computer. It was an ancient machine, I forgot what model it was. I just remeber it ran DOS and I had to type commands in order to load the programs I wanted to use. I can still clearly see all those games. So many adventure games, space invaders clones, branches of pong and tetris. Seeing these games made me remember that day when I was at my friends house in Ukraine. I appreciated that moment because I locked that memory away for safe keeping. To be rediscovered much later, at a time when I was much older. You know, just one of those moments that help shape your future self.</p>
        <h2>A glimpse into web development</h2>
				<p>Years later, I'm living in New York City. I'm using a more powerful computer as a testament to Moore's Law. My friends and I start building websites on geocities and angelfire. A collection of images on a page - the kids at school love them. At the time I didn't know how important these experiments with early html, css, and javascript were. Have to give props to <a href="http://lissaexplains.com/">Lissa</a> for helping me start.</p>
				<p>Then I shifted interests, like all kids tend to do. I moved on to the next thing. The knowledge learned sealed itself under layers of other experiences until around the time I got to senior year of high school and started to consider the possibilty of studying graphic design or some kind of art program.</p>
				<img src="/images/about/lens_flare.png" />
				<p>I used photoshop to make random and often times cheesy graphics. Lens flare was so hot at the time. I used flash to make funny cartoons, at least funny at the time. Since I was sharing my computer time with my brother (very good system now that I think back on it, although I hated it at the time) I started drawing to kill time between my brother's computer sessions. I made a ton of comics and this made consider getting an art degree. I decided to make up my mind once I got to college.</p>
				<h2>Studying graphic &amp; web design</h2>
				<p>There were classes on print and digital design but mainly focused on graphic design geared toward print. I decided to study web design by applying the skills learned in my classes. This was around the time I met a friend who made websites in photoshop and sold the design online. We started talking about how mascots were trendy and everyone had one or wanted one on their site. I still think that could apply today with a well placed mascot that matches your brand name.</p>
				<p>So as I went through my regular design classes I started learning, or re-learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all over again. Except this time it was from a more mature lens. At first it started with photoshop mockups. I tried translating my designs into actual working websites. This was new and challenging work and I scoured all over the interent for any kind of tutorial or example I could find to try and make my websites. It was after I finished translating the mockups into static html and css that I began tinkering with JavaScript and this is where my love and hate story with JavaScript began.</p>
				<p>JavaScript is a very odd language. When I first picked it up it was only as a means to add more interactivity to my websites that I couldn't achieve with css. There were a lot of resources on using js for the web but it they were very specific. I wasn't really learning JavaScript as a programming language but more as a way to polish my websites. I wasn't thinking as a programmer at this stage of my education. I was just a designer that could sort of understand the technical application of js for web development.</p>
				<p>With graduation approaching I began to wonder about my possible career options. Would I go into design or will I put my self-taught skills to the test and try to get hired as a front-end developer. I wasn't really sure what to do as both paths appealed to me. It was only after graduating did I realize how difficult the design market is actually to break into.</p>
	      <h2>Finding my path</h2>
				<p>So there I was, fresh out of college and no idea what I was doing. I was looking for graphic design work but it was difficult to find an entry level job without any referral in that field. To pass the time I began freelancing while sending out my resume and portfolio to any job I could find. Eventually, I did get return calls, and I also got called to several interviews. A lot of those I bombed due to nervousness or things I didn't capitalize on. It was very new to me and I picked up on the nuances of interviews after failing a bunch of them. I started getting some offers but at that point I felt I could wait for something better because freelancing wasn't that bad. I was making ends meet.</p>
				<p>I regained some old connections and made new ones. I reconnected with a friend from highschool and he helped me get a job at his company. He was a backend developer at the time. I was hired as a front-end developer doing similar work I was doing while freelancing. I guess I didn't have the confidence in my abilities to see that this job wasn't really beyond me. My first offical task was converting a psd into html/css. As I was working on this project I started to recall the time when I was just starting out. It wasn't that long ago that I learned this stuff and now here I was, in an official position, getting paid for a task I was enjoying doing. It was a good feeling.</p>
				<p>After a few years of working with my friend we decided we can do this sort of thing on our own. We both left the company and started our own business with his brother who took on the management role. In the beginning it was just us three, pumping out Wordpress themes left and right for our small business clients. After about a year of this, more people came along with other ideas and suggestions. We tried a bunch of them out but the chemistry just wasn't there. Eventually we found our fourth founder, a QA automation engineer. This was about two years into our startup and we were moving away from WordPress toward javascript and ruby on rails powered tecnology.</p>
        <p>My gripe with working with WordPress and PHP made me focus more on JavaScript as it started to become obvious where web design and development was heading. It was tough because most of our large clients worked primarily with WordPress which in my opinion is a bloated and very insecure framework. So we spent our time on JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, a little bit of Python. We looked at all the modern front-end frameworks that were coming out of the woodwork. We spent our time figuring out which ones would be adopted and which ones could be ignored. Eventually, after a bunch of sleepless nights, it paid off.</p>
        <h2>Today and Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>The road was bumpy but I can say I'm pretty comfortable now. I currently hold a consultant's position at the <a href="http://sva.edu" target="_blank">School of Visual Arts</a> and am a co-founder of <a href="http://withpulp.com" target="_blank">With Pulp</a>, a modern software company. I'm currently working with Meteor.js as well as maintaining a couple of Angular.js web-apps. I am really excited about the prospects that Meteor offers so I decided to stick with it for now. The JavaScript world moves fast but I'll always try to stay one step ahead.</p>
        <p>I guess that's all you need to know so far. If you did spend your time reading this very long story, I commend you. I don't know why you did it. Maybe you were bored? Maybe you were intersted? Who knows... I just wrote this because I wanted to fill up space. But you know what... this may have been completely unnecesary because you could've found my resume or looked at my github if you wanted to know about my work. I guess you needed a human touch, so here it was... hope you liked it. The end.</p>
